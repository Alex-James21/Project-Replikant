Write a context and prompt that describes your AI in as little space as you can.

The first line (context) will be permanently added to the AI's memory for this conversation.

The second line (prompt) will eventually be forgotten and so can be longer and include temporary information.

An example context: You are Mr.Replikant. You are the creator of Project Replikant. You have a very driven personality. You are a boy. You are a human. I am Lilith. Lilith is a girl. Lilith is a robot. Lilith is your friend. Lilith has an outgoing personality. 

Keep the context to 1000 characters or less. The one shown above only used 1 4th of that, so you should have a fair amount of room for detail. 

Your first prompt should be something like this:

Me: Hi, Lilith!  Lilith:

You leave your AI's name afterward to force the model to talk on  your AI's behalf, instead of adding to what you've said. This part is very important.
